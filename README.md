- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Adam.
- ðŸ‘€ I work in Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Financing Investigations.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning various languages, such as SQL, Python, and Powershell. I am relatively new to this, as I began really focusing on this around October of 2024.
- ðŸ˜Ž My goal is to learn more about various languages. I am mainly focused on SQL and Python, as well as Powershell.
- I have recently discovered Pentesting and found it very interesting. I hope to one day be able to bring my investigative experience from AML/CTF and step into the cyber security industry. If that does not happen, then I plan to use any new skills towards data analytics/investigations related to my current job functions.

- Projects: I have created multiple "bad USBs" which use the CMD function to execute small pranks. Since I am learning this on my own, these projects are very basic and do not have a real world use. I created these to get a better understanding of how the payloads are written and what each line does in relation to the payload. I have been working on a bad USB that extracts all wifi passwords along with the corresponding SSID, and saves the information on a .txt file. This project is currently under development and I am trying to learn how one would be able to take that .txt file and automatically send it to an email or dropbox, for remote access. I have also created a Powershell script that I use at work that pulls up my email, and numerous job-related programs, that I use on a daily basis. I use RPI Pico Ws and RP2040 chips for my bad USBs. The projects put on the Pico Ws can also be executed remotely via AP.

- Since I am learning this stuff on my own time, I often research on Google and Chat GPT, to get a better understanding of how scripts are constructed and what various commands do while running a script. All my projects listed above were made by me and were not "copy/pasted" from Google/Chat GPT, I only use those tools to get an understanding of how something is used in a script or how it needs to be formatted. Once I get more projects made, I will post them on my Github. They will not be pretty, but I am trying my best lol.

- I typically jump betweens different books, so I dont get burnt out on any given topic, but currently, I am reading "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart, "Black Hat Python" by Justin Seitz and Tim Arnold, and "Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach" by James Kurose and Keith Ross.
